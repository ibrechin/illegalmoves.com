Summary: A week in the mostly sunshine on Rarotonga

Despite a slightly overcast and rainy start, my week on the Cook Islands was predominantly hot and sunny. I don't really have much to say about it - I relaxed, did some diving, went to an "island night", did some trekking...it was all pretty nice but nothing particularly noteworthy. The accomodation I stayed at - a little village of chalets - was pleasantly communal, and I whiled away most evenings chatting with the rest of the guests out on the decking up at the main house.  

I landed in LA today, but I'm only intending to spend one night here. My plan is to get out on the road tomorrow morning and start heading north - need to try to find somewhere to break the journey between here and San Francisco.
