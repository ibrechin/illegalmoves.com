Summary: In which Ho Chi Minh City is revealed to be really fucking busy


Having returned to Tokyo, experienced my first earthquake, then spent an uncomfortable night sleeping on a bench in the airport, I have now left the home of the samurai and am instead in the home of...um, people on motorbikes, I guess.

Because there are a lot of people of motorbikes here in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon, as was). Advice given to travellers attempting to cross the road is:  

1) Just cross, if you're waiting for a gap in the traffic you're going to be waiting a long time.  
2) Walk slowly and consistently, don't try and dodge, let people on bikes weave around you.  

Based on my experience, I would like to add:  

3) Don't take 1) or 2) completely seriously, you moron - firstly it is a good idea to wait until there is *less* traffic, and secondly if a bike is coming right for you don't just let it hit you, stop and let it past or get the fuck out of the way.  

I mean 3) is pretty obvious really, I haven't seen anyone who hasn't worked it out, although I had a great deal of difficulty applying it on my way back to the hotel during rush hour just now. Anyway this place is incredibly busy and stressful and I am getting the hell out of here.
