Summary: Day in Hiroshima


I'm really starting to enjoy okonomiyaki. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I've seen it offered at any of the Japanese food joints in London (Wagamamas etc), which is a pity because it's tasty and filling. I am currently in Hiroshima, and for dinner I went to a building which contains three floors just of independant okonomiyaki stalls. If one had the time I expect it would be possible to narrow down precisely which one does the dish the best, but as it is I had to go with the one where the cook was an awesome little old lady.

It was delicious, which made a more cheerful end to a day which had otherwise been, whilst interesting, a bit of a downer.
